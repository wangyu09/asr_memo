## Feature

In [feature](./feature), there are some feature extracting functions.  
1. (power) spectrogram feature.  
2. fbank feature.  
3. mfcc feature.   
4. energy feature.  
5. add delta to feature.  

## Gaussian Mixture Model

In [gmm](./gmm), there are some functions to train and test a GMM model.  
1. k-means algorithm.    
2. compute MFCC feature from files.  
3. train a GMM model with EM algorithm (Support parallel threads).
